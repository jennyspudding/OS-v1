# 🔧 Correct Application Fix - Jenny's Pudding Store

## ❌ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

The browser was loading the **admin-app** instead of the **jennys-pudding** store application.

### Root Cause:
- Multiple Node.js applications running simultaneously
- Admin-app was occupying port 3000 or 3001
- Browser was connecting to the wrong application

## ✅ **SOLUTION APPLIED**

### 1. **Stopped All Node.js Processes**
```powershell
Get-Process -Name "node" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
```

### 2. **Navigated to Correct Directory**
```powershell
cd jennys-pudding
```

### 3. **Started Jenny's Pudding Store**
```powershell
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 **CORRECT APPLICATION STRUCTURE**

### 📁 **jennys-pudding** (Customer Store)
- **Purpose**: E-commerce store for customers
- **Features**: 
  - Product browsing and shopping
  - Cart functionality
  - Delivery integration with Lalamove
  - Customer checkout process
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:3001`
- **Should Show**: Jenny's Pudding store with pink branding

### 📁 **admin-app** (Admin Dashboard)
- **Purpose**: Admin panel for managing orders
- **Features**:
  - Order management
  - Status updates
  - Admin authentication
- **URL**: Different port (when needed)
- **Should Show**: Admin dashboard interface

## 🚀 **VERIFICATION**

Now when you visit `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:3001`, you should see:

✅ **Jenny's Pudding Store** with:
- Pink/cream background (`#ffe9ea`)
- "Jenny's Pudding" header with logo
- Search bar for products
- Hero banners carousel
- Product categories and grid
- Shopping cart functionality

❌ **NOT the admin dashboard** with:
- Login forms
- Order management tables
- Admin interface

## 🔧 **How to Run Each Application**

### For Customer Store (jennys-pudding):
```bash
cd jennys-pudding
npm run dev
```

### For Admin Dashboard (admin-app):
```bash
cd admin-app
npm run dev
```

**⚠️ Important**: Only run ONE at a time to avoid port conflicts!

## 🎉 **ISSUE RESOLVED**

The Jenny's Pudding customer store should now be running correctly at:
- **http://localhost:3000** or **http://localhost:3001**

You should see the beautiful pink-themed e-commerce store, not the admin dashboard!
