# 🏍️ Auto Delivery Calculation with Motorcycle Default

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. **Auto-Calculate on Location Selection**
- When user selects a location on the map, delivery fee is **automatically calculated**
- **Motorcycle is always set as default** when a new location is selected
- Calculation happens 1 second after location selection

### 2. **Auto-Calculate on Page Load**
- When user returns to the page with a saved location, it **auto-calculates with motorcycle**
- Only calculates if no previous quotation exists
- Waits for all data to load before calculating

### 3. **Easy Vehicle Type Switching**
- User can click **Motor** or **Mobil** buttons to change vehicle type
- **Instant recalculation** when vehicle type is changed
- Visual feedback shows which option is selected

### 4. **Clear UI Indicators**
- Motorcycle button shows **(Default)** label
- Section header shows **(Motor dipilih otomatis)**
- Motorcycle described as "Lebih cepat & murah (Default)"

## 🔄 User Flow

1. **User enters location** → 🏍️ **Auto-calculates with MOTORCYCLE**
2. **User wants different vehicle** → 🚗 **Clicks CAR button** → **Auto-recalculates**
3. **User changes location** → 🏍️ **Resets to MOTORCYCLE** → **Auto-calculates**
